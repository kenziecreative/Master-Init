# /sanity-check

Run this to verify the project is in a clean, consistent state. This check adapts to the current state of the project — it only checks what exists.

## Behavior

### 1. Code Health (skip if no code exists yet)

Detect the project's toolchain and run whatever applies:
- **Compilation/type check**: Run the project's build or type-check command
- **Test suite**: Run tests if a test framework is configured
- **Lint**: Run the linter if configured
- **Debug artifacts**: Scan for console.log/print statements, TODO/FIXME/HACK comments, hardcoded localhost URLs, hardcoded file paths containing /Users/ or /home/

If no build/test/lint commands are established yet, skip this section and note: "Code health checks will activate once build tooling is configured."

### 2. Documentation Currency

Read and verify these files are current (check whichever exist):

1. **`.planning/STATE.md`** — Does the current position match reality? Is the last activity date current?
2. **`CLAUDE.md`** — Does it reflect the actual project state?
3. **`.planning/LEARNINGS.md`** — Were recent insights captured?

If any are stale, update them now.

### 3. Context Handoff

Verify that a fresh session would understand the project:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` — does it point to the right starting docs?
2. Read `.planning/STATE.md` — would a new session know where to resume?
3. Are there implicit decisions from this session that need documenting?

### 4. Summary

Output a summary table:

| Check | Status | Issues |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Code Health | pass/skip/fail | ... |
| Documentation | pass/fail | ... |
| Context Handoff | pass/fail | ... |

If all pass: **"Sanity check passed. Safe to clear context or proceed."**

If any fail, fix them before proceeding.

## When to Run

- Before clearing context on a long session
- Before starting a new major task or milestone
- After a significant refactoring or architectural change
- When something feels "off" about the project state
